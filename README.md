# Rapid SARS-CoV-2 Variant Tracking through Weighted Network Analysis of Frequency Trajectories of Mutations
Early identification of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants has been able to timely track the emergence of clinically important strains and inform the public health response. Here, we proposed a weighted network framework to model the Frequency Trajectories of Mutations (FTMs) for SARS-CoV-2 variant tracing.
